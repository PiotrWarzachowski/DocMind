# Welcome to Docmind üìë

You can see and test the application here: https://doc-mind.vercel.app
Docmind is a **Next.js** application that allows you to **talk with your PDF**. It uses custom **vector database with OpenAI API** to perform search, it **works preety amazing** üòé, you can **see showcase** in documentation. Documentation is done using gitbook, you can find it **[here](https://docmind.gitbook.io/docmind/)**. Feel free to **star this project** ‚≠ê. Contributors are welcome.



# Small Showcase üéûÔ∏è
**Whole showcase** can be seen in the **Documentation section** link below.

# Tech stack üßë‚Äçüíª
The project uses top notch web technologies. 
* **Next.js 14.0.1** with App router.
* **Prisma 5.7.1**, for Postgre SQL database integration.
* **Next Auth v4**, for user authentication.
*  **OpenAI API**, to perform correct vestor search.
*  **Pinecone**, to store vectors in the database.
*  **Uploadthing**, to upload PDF files and store them.

# Installation üíª
In this part I describe how to **run the project** locally.
## Third party tools

First you **need to setup all third party tools**, and set corresponding **environmental variables**. I strongly **recommend using same tools as I did**, to not have any bugs (all of them are free).

* **Postgre SQL server**, in my case I used **[neon.tech](https://neon.tech)**. You should set **DATABASE_URL** variable 
to your corresponding Postgre SQL server link.

* **PDF File storing server**,  in my case I used **[uploadthing.com](https://uploadthing.com)**. You should set **UPLOADTHING_SECRET**, **UPLOADTHING_APP_ID** to your corresponding variables.

* **Vector database for LLM**, in my case I used **[pinecone.io](https://pinecone.io)** . You should set **PINECONE_API_KEY** to your corresponding api key.

* **OpenAI API key**, you can find the API key **[here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)** this is needed for the LLM to perform search over vector database. You should set **OPENAI_API_KEY** to your corresponding api key.

* **Github Auth support**, you can create your own app **[here](https://github.com/settings/apps)** when creating the app **set Callback URL** to ```http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github```, then set **GITHUB_CLIENT_ID**, **GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET** to your values.

* **Google Auth support**, you can create your own app **[here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient) set callback URL** to ```http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google```, then continue process of creating the app 
and insert **GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET** environmental variables.
* **Next Auth Secret**, you can use this command to get it : `openssl rand -base64 32` or get the random code from **[here](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32)**, then assign **NEXTAUTH_SECRET** to the generated value. **NEXTAUTH_URL** should be your home page URL, for default settings **http://localhost:3000**

## Getting started
List of commands in order to build the app locally. 

Firstly, install all dependencies:


```bash
npm install
```

Secondly, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Open your browser and go to **http://localhost:3000** to see the result. If you see the homepage, it works.

# Build üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Here I describe how to build the project locally or online

## Hosting on third party server
in order to build the application and host it on third party server, here is an official **[Next.js docummentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying)**.

## Hosting on Vercel
The easiest way to deploy Next.js app is to use the **[Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new)** from the creators of Next.js.
Check out **[Next.js deployment docummentattion](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying)** for more details.
